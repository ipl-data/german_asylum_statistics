# This data is based on the monthly asylum statistics (Asylgesch√§ftsstatistik) 
# by the BAMF. The individual reports can be found here:
# http://www.bamf.de/DE/Infothek/Statistiken/Asylzahlen/Asylgesch%C3%A4ftsstatistik/asylgeschaeftsstatistik-node.html

# The data covers the period from January 2015 to January 2017. The data was
# collected using a mix of OCR techniques and manual copy-paste. Surprising data
# should therefore be double checked with the actual reports. 

# The data contains information on refugees from each month's top 10 sending 
# countries, the aggreagated top 10 and the aggregate numbers of all refugees.
# Values are running totals (percentages) per year. On some occasions the totals
# drop from one month to the other. I assume that this is due to data cleaning
# on the side of BAMF.
